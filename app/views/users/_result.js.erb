document.querySelector('#results').innerHTML = "<%= j render 'users/result.html' %>"  
/* j (which is an alias for the escape_javascript method) is used to escape whatever will be returned by the ruby code 
   to make sure that everything between the quotes will be valid and that the string will not be broken. Example:
   document.querySelector("#reviews").innerHTML = "<a href="/mycontroller/myaction">Action!</a>" */
